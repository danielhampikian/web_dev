## Notes for Lecture Prep ##

Need some stuff set up ahead of time - but what is necessary?
Just images/content, or a beginning of the script?

### Possible order: ###
1. Setup canvas and player as a blob ✓
2. Get movement with left-right key listening ✓
3. Get the friction and boundaries so player stops ✓
4. Get jumping and gravity ✓
(Now we diverge from the tutorial) 
5. Add a background and change the boundary limits for the player ✓
6. Change the player to something better looking
7. Add some animations for the player??
8. ??
